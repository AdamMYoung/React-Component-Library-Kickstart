# Welcome to the React-Component-Library UI Storybook Project

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `src/` directory to learn how they work.
This template has been designed around the use of bootstrap for consistency within the company.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.

## Styling

Within the _css_ folder, you will find a selection of scss files used as bootstrap overrides and main css imports in the application.
When applying styles, bootstrap overrides are typically the first place to look when modifying the general feel of the app.

To use this in production, within the implementing application's **main.scss** file, import `~*NPM_NAME*/scss/main.scss` after importing the bootstrap scss files.
